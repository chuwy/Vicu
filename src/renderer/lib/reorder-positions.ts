// Where a dragged task gets its position. Vikunja orders a list view by a float `position` per
// task. In the default order ("Due date, then manual") the list shows dated tasks first (by date)
// and then the undated ones by position (see task-sort.ts), so only undated positions mean anything
// and only they anchor a drop. In the manual order every row is in position order and every row
// anchors (`anchorsFor`, cross-app semantics 12.4).
//
// A drop normally sends one position, the middle between the undated neighbours. That fails when
// the neighbours share a position, which is common: every task moved into a project gets position
// 0 in its list view, and repeated drops in the same gap converge. The middle of two equal numbers
// is the same number, so the task stayed where it was and the drag looked like it did nothing
// (the Inbox reorder bug). When there is no room, the undated tasks are spread out again in their
// new order.
